I am using terraform to automate my k8s setup on aws graviton instances running ubuntu 24.04 arm64. I am sourcing a setup script and it is failing with logging . Please review the scripts and provide an explanation to assist with verifying the terraform templating that produces bash scripts on the ec2 instance is correct. All scripts are placed in the same /tmp/k8s_scripts directory on the remote machine and use shared functions where required. Attached are the scripts that are loaded from s3 and the entrypoint.log contains this text at the end. There is also a terraform-templating-discrepencies.txt that includes what we have discovered attempting this task in order to provide you with context.
